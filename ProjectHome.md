All code built with Eclipse (Galileo and Ganymede)
Arduino core (0015 and 0012) extended to enable build for the Atmel AT90USB1287 and the AT90USBKey Development Board.
Slight rewrite of Reprap code to separate files and improve build.
The workspace has a demo of an integrated LUFA, Reprap and Arduino build which will (soon) allow native USB comms for Reprap (a few little bugs to go).
